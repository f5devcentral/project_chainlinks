Project Chain Links
-------------------

Hey there, community! Many moons ago my good friend and colleague "THE" Colin Walker 
started a series of iRules challenges for our sales engineers at their new hire boot 
camps and then published the results here at DevCentral. Personally, I have used 
Project Euler for my own development or for mentoring students I've worked with. 
In shoring up my own python language-specific skills, I use PyBites and Python Morsels. 
All these are great for the busy technologist because they offer three things:

1. A clear problem to solve
2. A focused, bite-sized problem that can be tackled at lunch or on a break
3. A solution to validate your efforts

That brings me to the point of this new article series. The idea is to release a 
challenge on a frequent basis with a solution released the following week in a GitHub
repo. Different from Colin’s original series? It will not be limited to iRules. It 
could be solution oriented, an investigation into the power of a command line tool, 
or any number of API-related queries.

Final order of business before jumping in: why the name? Well, it’s an homage and/or 
an amalgamation of Project Euler, the BIG-IP hud chain, and the F5 automation toolchain. 
The goal here is to build the requisite skills bite by bite to connect all these 
chainlinks into a suite of skills at your disposal.
